    <h1>Max Mosier's HTML Midterm Changelog</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Changes made:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All Pages</li>
            <ul>
                <li class="add">Added a link to Page 5 in all pages' navbars</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <li>Page 1</li>
            <ul>
                <li class="add">Added doctype element</li>
                <li class="add">Added HTML element with attribute: lang="en"</li>
                <li class="alt">Fixed what was supposed to be a closing &lt;/em&gt;, surrounding the word "cr√®me fraiche," which had been written as &lt;e&gt;</li>
                <li><strong>Completed</strong> as of most recent change.</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <li>Page 2</li>
            <ul>
                <li class="alt">Filled an empty pair of &lt;&gt; intendede to be a &lt;/b&gt; tag on line 26.</li>
                <li class="sub">Removed a &lt;b&gt; element enclosing an &lt;h2&gt; element. h2 is already bolded, and so enclosing it was done erroneously.</li>
                <li class="alt">Added an absolute link to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_arch">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_arch</a> to an anchor tag in which the link had been missing, replaced with the text "where do i go."</li>
                <li>Now free of errors. However, formatting issues remain.</li>
                <!-- <li class="alt">The "Interior" header was marked as being h3, while the style of the rest of the page indicated it should have been h2. So, changed it to h2.</li> -->
                <li class="alt">The "History" section of the page had mistakenly been marked as an h6 element. Changed it to h3 to match the rest of the sections (Which I think should have been h2, anyways).</li>
                <li class="alt">Following the pattern of all other links on the page, I added a link to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay</a> where a link to <a href="www.brokenlink.com">www.brokenlink.com</a> had been used.</li>
                <li class="add">Following the pattern indicated by the majority of the given elements, added a horizontal rule beneath the "Closure" and "Interior" headers.</li>
                <li class="unknown">Noticed that the link whose text read "Bradford Corporation" leads to the Wikipedia page for the <em>City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council</em>. 
                                    I thought this might be wrong due to the name difference, but upon further examination, I found that it's correct.</li>
                <li class="unknown">British English spellings used throughout the document: panelling, centred, storey, licence, and organisation. I did not change these, but felt this was worth noting.</li>
                <li><strong>Completed</strong>, to my knowledge, as of the most recent change.</li>
             </ul>
        <br>
        <li>Page 3</li>
            <ul>
                <li class="alt">In the list in the "Basic Description" section, &lt;l&gt; tags were erroneously used to indicate a list item. Replaced with &lt;li&gt;.</li>
                <li class="alt">In the table at the bottom of the page, the closing tag of a &lt;td&gt; element was mistyped as just &lt;/&gt;. Replaced with &lt;/td&gt;</li>
                <li class="alt">Making some assumptions about the table's intended format, I moved some of the &lt;td&gt; elements into different table rows. Specifically "Lily," and Olatunkbo's age, "22" which were both misplaced.</li>
                <li class="alt">Axelia's name, a &lt;td&gt; element, was not placed in a row. Moved it to the appropriate row.</li>
                <li class="alt">Javier Zapata's last name was set as a table header element, but should have been a &lt;td&gt;. Changed it to a &lt;td&gt;.</li>
                <li class="add">Added &lt;sup&gt; around "[6]" on the page. I also found the original website where the text was from, and saw it had a tooltip when you hovered over the [6], so I added that as well, using an anchor tag.</li>
                <li></li>
