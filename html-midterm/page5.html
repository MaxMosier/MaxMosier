    <h1>Max Mosier's HTML Midterm Changelog</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Changes made:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All Pages
            <ul>
                <li class="add">Added a link to Page 5 in all pages' navbars</li>
            </ul><br>
        </li>
        <li>Page 1
            <ul>
                <li class="add">Added doctype element</li>
                <li class="add">Added HTML element with attribute: lang="en"</li>
                <li class="alt">Fixed what was supposed to be a closing &lt;/em&gt;, surrounding the word "cr√®me fraiche," which had been written as &lt;e&gt;</li>
                <li><strong>Completed</strong> as of most recent change.</li>
            </ul><br>
        </li>
        <li>Page 2
            <ul>
                <li class="alt">Filled an empty pair of &lt;&gt; intendede to be a &lt;/b&gt; tag on line 26.</li>
                <li class="sub">Removed a &lt;b&gt; element enclosing an &lt;h2&gt; element. h2 is already bolded, and so enclosing it was done erroneously.</li>
                <li class="alt">Added an absolute link to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_arch">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_arch</a> to an anchor tag in which the link had been missing, replaced with the text "where do i go."</li>
                <li>Now free of errors. However, formatting issues remain.</li>
                <!-- <li class="alt">The "Interior" header was marked as being h3, while the style of the rest of the page indicated it should have been h2. So, changed it to h2.</li> -->
                <li class="alt">The "History" section of the page had mistakenly been marked as an h6 element. Changed it to h3 to match the rest of the sections (Which I think should have been h2, anyways).</li>
                <li class="alt">Following the pattern of all other links on the page, I added a link to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay</a> where a link to <a href="www.brokenlink.com">www.brokenlink.com</a> had been used.</li>
                <li class="add">Following the pattern indicated by the majority of the given elements, added a horizontal rule beneath the "Closure" and "Interior" headers.</li>
                <li><strong>Completed</strong>, to my knowledge, as of the most recent change. <br><br></li>
                <li class="unknown">Noticed that the link whose text read "Bradford Corporation" leads to the Wikipedia page for the <em>City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council</em>.
                                    I thought this might be wrong due to the name difference, but upon further examination, I found that it's correct.</li>
                <li class="unknown">British English spellings used throughout the document: panelling, centred, storey, licence, and organisation. I did not change these, but felt this was worth noting.</li>
             </ul><br>
        </li>
        <li>Page 3
            <ul>
                <li class="alt">In the list in the "Basic Description" section, &lt;l&gt; tags were erroneously used to indicate a list item. Replaced with &lt;li&gt;.</li>
                <li class="alt">In the table at the bottom of the page, the closing tag of a &lt;td&gt; element was mistyped as just &lt;/&gt;. Replaced with &lt;/td&gt;</li>
                <li class="alt">Making some assumptions about the table's intended format, I moved some of the &lt;td&gt; elements into different table rows. Specifically "Lily," and Olatunkbo's age, "22" which were both misplaced.</li>
                <li class="alt">Axelia's name, a &lt;td&gt; element, was not placed in a row. Moved it to the appropriate row.</li>
                <li class="alt">Javier Zapata's last name was set as a table header element, but should have been a &lt;td&gt;. Changed it to a &lt;td&gt;.</li>
                <li class="add">Added &lt;sup&gt; around "[6]" on the page. I also found the original website where the text was from, and saw it had a tooltip when you hovered over the [6], so I added that as well, using an anchor tag.</li>
                <li><strong>Completed</strong>, I think. This one seemed to have suspiciously few errors... Made one change that was more subjective in nature, described in the bullet below:<br><br></li>
                <li class="ukAlt">The "Simple Table" header is of the type h4, and the "Basic Description" header it's under is h3. I personally feel these should be h3 and h2 respectively, and so made this change. Left a comment where I did this.</li>
                <li class="unknown">Not sure if this is intentional or something I'm supposed to correct, but the bulleted list on this page does seem to have three elements which end in a semicolon, one that ends in a period, and one that has no punctuation. 
                                    I left it as is, but felt this might be worth mentioning...</li>
            </ul><br>
        </li>
        <li>Page 4
            <ul>
                <li class="add">Added the doctype element at the top of the page.</li>
                <li class="add">Added alt text to all images. They all look like they're AI generated, so I included that in their descriptions.</li>
                <li class="add">Added opening and closing &lt;td&gt; tags to the image element containing orangeCat.png, which was supposed to be a piece of table data</li>
                <li class="add">Added an opening &lt;td&gt; tag to the image element containing creature.png. It already had a closing tag, though.</li>
                <li class="alt">All of the images were arranged along the wrong axis. All dog-related images were in the same row, and the same was the case for the other two subjects. 
                                However, the format of the table indicated that the images were supposed to be sorted with columns corresponding to image subject. So, I've moved all the elements so that they are arranged correctly 
                                (Mirrored along NW-SE diagonal)</li>
                <li><strong>Completed?</strong> All I've done is rearrange the table, add some alt text, and add three tags... This one also seems to be suspiciously lacking in errors.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
