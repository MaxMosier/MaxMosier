							Project Description: <br>
							<br>
							While brainstorming ideas for this project, I was inspired by
							<a href="https://youtu.be/X-iSQQgOd1A">this video</a> to make some sort of particle-like
							simulation program. To make it interactive, I decided it would be fun to have the user
							control the general motions of the "entities," as I call them, using their mouse! Going off
							of pretty much just that idea, I developed what I have now. Along the way, I made a lot of
							subjective decisions about certain variables such as the weights of influences of entities
							on each other, and in part out of being annoyed by having to constantly go and adjust the
							code to test out different weights, I eventually decided to give the power to control such
							variables to the user. This, I feel, makes for a slightly more fun page, as well. I could
							have included a lot more options, but didn't want to overcomplicate things, or do anything
							that would require a long description, and so settled on a few variables I felt were the
							easiest to understand. <br><br>
							How to Use: <br><br>

							On a computer, click and drag your mouse to leave behind a trail the "entities" will follow!
							By default, there is a visible trail you leave behind (which as you can see slowly fades
							away). You can click the "Show Drawn Paths" button to toggle this feature.<br><br>

							When entities get near one another, they begin turning to match the direction of others
							around them. By default, this happens quite slowly. The "Entity-Entity Influence" slider
							controls this influence entities have on each others' direction. When at 100% strength, this
							will result in a lot of clustering, while a strength of 0%, the entities will simply move
							around loosely.
