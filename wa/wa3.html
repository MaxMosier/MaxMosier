        The eastern coyote is a wild North American canine hybrid with both coyote and wolf parentage. The hybridization
        likely first occurred in the Great Lakes region, as western coyotes moved east. It was first noticed during the
        early 1930s to the late 1940s, and likely originated in the aftermath of the extirpation of the gray wolf in
        southeastern Ontario, Labrador and Quebec, thus allowing coyotes to colonize the former wolf ranges, and mix
        with the remnant wolf populations.[1][2] This hybrid is smaller than the eastern wolf and holds smaller
        territories, but is larger and holds more extensive home ranges than the typical western coyote
