				<h1>Road Traffic Accidents Between Manchester and Leeds</h1>
				<p>
					This map visualizes the number of crashes between Manchester and Leeds in 2020. The brightness of
					each point represents the recorded lighting conditions at the time of the crash, with the brightest
					points represented more well-lit conditions, and darker points indicating darker conditions. Bright
					red points (Which I now realize, given the map's color, may be a bit hard to make out) represent
					those for which no lighting conditions were recorded.
				</p>
				<p>
					The size of each point is determined by the number of vehicles which were involved in the accident.
					In this map, the greatest number of vehicles involved was 7! The number of vehicles is also given as
					a number next to each point. Singular vehicle counts represent a driver doing something like going
					off road or hitting something.
