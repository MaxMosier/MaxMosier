                <h1>Road Traffic Accidents Between Manchester and Leeds</h1>
                <p>This map visualizes the number of crashes between Manchester and Leeds in 2020. The brightness of each point represents the recorded lighting conditions at the time of the crash, with the brightest points represented more well-lit conditions, and darker points indicating darker conditions. Bright red points (Which I now realize, given the map's color, may be a bit hard to make out) represent those for which no lighting conditions were recorded.  </p>
